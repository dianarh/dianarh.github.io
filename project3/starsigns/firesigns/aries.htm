	<p>Aries is the first of the zodiac signs. Aries is the sign of the self, people born under this sign strongly project their personalities onto others and can be very self-oriented. Aries tend to venture out into the world and leave impressions on others that they are exciting, vibrant and talkative. Aries tend to live adventurous lives and like to be the center of attention, but rightly so since they are natural, confident leaders. Aries are enthusiastic about their goals and enjoy the thrill of the hunt, "wanting is always better then getting" is a good way to sum it up. Aries are very impulsive and usually do not think before they act - or speak. Too often Aries will say whatever pops into their head and usually end up regretting it later!

	<div class="col-sm-6">
	<p>Aries gets things started and then pursues them with gusto (but maybe not much practical common sense). Life is like a battle to be entered into and won. Your will must prevail. All is possible. If impossible it just takes a little longer (or so you believe). If not the team leader Aries will battle with whoever is. Acts first, thinks afterwards when it may be too late. Reckless and short-sighted. Fundamentally, Aries' function is to be the initiator, the one who gets things started. So Aries' function in life is to get things moving. The contributions all the other signs have to offer depend on someone providing the initial impulse. Aries is a fire sign, and fire has to do with inspiration and imagination. Your aim is to bring these qualities into life and act on them.

If confronted, Aries can turn to be quite childish, they will fight back with their agressive nature and are known to have temper tantrums should they not get their way.</p>

	<h2>DATING ARIES WOMEN</h2>
		</div><!-- signheader -->
		<p>Dating an Aries never lacks excitement. She is hot-blooded, and forceful, so you had better be able to handle the heat! The Aries woman is for the person who likes an independent self-driven woman who can fend for herself and is not clingy and needy. An Aries woman requires freedom. For the Aries woman, the best part of the relationship is the beginning, then the spark is there and she is trying to catch you to be hers. She will find happiness in a long-term relationship because she enjoys sharing everything with her partner. She will not only have a romantic partner but a best friend too. She has a great need for love and passion but she will never let a man become the master, she considers her partner to be equal. Aries women are not for domineering men. She will be faithful but she expects the same in return. She can be jealous because she wants a man to give her all of his attention, "all or nothing", so her jealously is rooted in her possessiveness, she has to be number one in his eyes.</p>

	<h2>DATING ARIES MEN</h2>
		</div><!-- signheader -->
	<p>An Aries man has a lust for adventure so if you are thinking about having a relationship with an Aries man, be prepared for fast-paced adventure, novelty and excitement. He is always eager to try new things - including relationships. That is not to say that every Aries man will only provide an exciting and short-lived relationship, but this is usually the case. He might stick around if you are the type of woman that enjoys having the man take the lead and basking in his glory. He enjoys challenge so if you are the woman to offer challenges to him - like playing hard to get - he might stick around longer. Remember, this man is all about the thrill of the chase. Do not however, act as if you don't care about him. He needs you to be "swept off your feet" by him. Appear innocent- hard-to-get and he will be wrapped around your little finger. Never take advantage of the Aries man because his short temper will turn into a fury of anger and he way leave and never look back.</p>

	<p>Let Aries know that you admire them, they thrive of admiration and followers. Let them know that you love their zest for life and that you find them intriguing, they love compliments more then most other astrology signs of the zodiac. Compliment them physically and mentally, they like conversation about intellectual topics and engage them in a lively discussion, or a friendly debate. They love the challenge and the stimulation of good, intelligent conversation. Ask them for advice, let them know that you look up to them. Remember, Aries is the first sign of the zodiac and the most forward and independent, they love followers. Do not be a push over, do not keep your opinions to yourself because Aries will quickly get bored if you agree with everything they say. Do not attempt to control them however, they do not like taking orders. Aries are very capable people so if you go with their plans, you are sure to have a good time! If they have a suggestion for something to do, go with the flow, they like to be in control of what goes on.

	<p>Underneath the strong, independent surface may lie insecurity. This is due to the intense drive to succeed and Aries put too much pressure on themselves, thus resulting in self-doubt however, the natural optimism and enthusiasm overtakes this and the underlying insecurity may never be known to others. When obstacles arise in the course of the enterprises they are pursuing they can become rather dumbfounded. Aries has trouble anticipating the exigencies that arise in the course of normal living. They can't imagine failing in their objectives so they deal with crises as they arise, often with a lack of wisdom. This headstrong ram can't grasp political maneuvering or the fine art of diplomacy.</p>

	<div class="col-sm-6">
	<p>Aries frequently ends up alienating people that are potential allies because they simply can't see situations from anything but their own perspective. In dealings with other people they are direct and honest. They don't hide their nature from others. This willingness to reveal himself, warts and all, is one of the more admirable traits of the ram. Aries only do things when they want to. If other people can fit themselves into their scheme then Aries is a wonderful and passionate companion. If they love you, they will fight wars on your behalf. However, if you get in the way of their freedom to pursue what they wish they are the most difficult of all types to contend with.</p>
