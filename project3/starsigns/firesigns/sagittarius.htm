	<p>Sagittarius seem to be guided by luck, good things happen to Sagittarius and this is usually because of their optimistic outlook and positive disposition which attracts good fortune. Despite hardships, Sagittarius is always optimistic that good things will happen tomorrow and the future carries good luck. Sagittarius have a vibrant, expansive personality that is free like a bird, Sagittarius cannot be contained. They are full of curiosity and they always look forward to the future, never dwelling on the past. Sagittarius are detached from emotions because emotions hold a person back, they do not like to talk about their feelings, they simply experience them and move on. </p>

	<div class="col-sm-6">
	<p>Sagittarius can be reckless and irresponsible because they will jump at a suggestion of something new before they weigh the advantages and disadvantages.Sagittarius strives for what is beyond day to day human experience, whether it travel to distant lands, broadening knowledge by education or by exploring the spiritual dimension of life. Sagittarius may look with disdain on those at home with earthy daily existence. If they consider themselves 'evolved' (ask them what that word means) may despise those who are not, or will attempt to educate them in spiritual matters and turn them into second-hand Sagittarians (advice to victims: stay true to yourselves).</p>

	<div class="col-sm-12">
	<p>Sagittarius make excellent friends because of their encouraging, positive nature and their kind heart that will do anything to make sure the friend is happy. They do not expect favors in return, their kindness is selfless. They do not interfere with other people's plans and they are never possessive or jealous. They treat others the way they want to be treated and life life based on a 'live and let live' policy, this makes them so agreeable. Sagittarius are excellent conversationalists with a good sense of humor, sometimes their humor is the raw truth, but these people speak their mind and don't hold anything back. What they say is what they mean, Sagittarius do not like mind games, it holds them back trying to figure out what is meant, they like straightforwardness and expect it in return. Sagittarius are known for saying the 'painful truth', but on the other hand, people know that they can trust what they say because they always say what is real. A Sagittarius never hides anything. Sagittarius are very likeable people. The only people that might not get along with them are people that live by a daily agenda with a highly structured, organized life. They are likely to always be running late and miss a date, but this is only because they are so forward thinking that they forget about the present. Tolerance is required, Sagittarius does not do these things on purpose, this is just who they are. If you understand this and accept this, having a Sagittarius in your life will make the sun shine a lot brighter.</p>

	<h2>DATING SAGITTARIUS WOMEN</h2>
		</div><!-- signheader -->
		<p>She has a great attitude and always seems to be on the go. Sagittarius woman is for the man with lots of energy and creativity. She likes unconventionality and change, so whisk her away last second to somewhere unplanned and uncharted and she will remember you forever. In order for her to stay, you have to keep her happy. If she gets unhappy or bored, she won't bother to fix any problems, she will just walk out and never look back. Fortunately, it is not that difficult to keep her happy. Be her friend, she does not take love to seriously anyway, if you are her companion, love will blossom after that. Let her have her freedom, flirt with her and take the relationship slowly, do not rush her. Be genuine, adventurous, and never play mind games. </p>

	<h2>DATING SAGITTARIUS MEN</h2>
		</div><!-- signheader -->
	<p>This man may be difficult to pin down. He loves the trill of the chase so he may be off trying to get other women at the same time you are trying to get him. He is sincere when we says he likes you but he means it to other women when he tells other women the same thing. He is not showy or romantic, and he tends to attract women who like the thrill of the chase themselves, which is not too bad of a gamble. In order to win him over, be modest about love, do not engage him in emotional commitment like conversations about being together in the future. Sagittarius is for the woman who does not want commitment or is afraid of being tied down in a relationship. This man is perfect for the adventurous, fearless female.</p>

	<p>Talk to them, ask them questions about themselves, share stories, make them laugh, but do not pry into intimate details about their life. Keep your emotional distance and they will be attracted to you. Easy. Suggest an outdoor date, something wild and wacky like floating on a boat down the river then having a picnic by the riverside, anything. They love activities. These are the easiest people to get a date with but don;t think that this is written in stone, they are the biggest commitment phoebe of all zodiac signs. Enjoy the time you've spent with Sagittarius and be prepared to move on or at least share them with others because they will be doing the same. All in good fun.

	<p>Sagittarius is a well adjusted person with no emotional problems holding them back. They just want to explore the world and not fret about feelings. Others may be hurt by their lack of commitment but Sags do not care. They are here to gain wisdom, learn, and explore. Sagittarius has problems finishing projects they start when they take too long to finish. They want immediate results and will move on to the next project if it takes too long. This is not because of laziness. The motivation to move on is due to their hatred of boredom. Boredom is their fear and instead of facing it, they will leave in search of something more stimulating. Sagittarius are not emotional people but they are easily hurt by a careless selfish action, their will be blue but turn it around pretty quickly with their naturally sunny disposition. They don't dwell on hurt because it is a waste of their energy.</p>
	</div><!-- col-sm-6 -->
	
	<div class="col-sm-6">
	<p>Sagittarius witnesses to the importance of deriving meaning from experience. From experience, that is, not from books, though reading the thoughts and searches for meaning of others can help in the quest. Consider the symbol or glyph for Sagittarius - a centaur. The rear half is that of a horse and the front half that of a human. The horse symbolises animal instinct - it isn't the rear half for nothing! The human symbolises the search for that which lies beyond animal instinct. The two are always together - meaning, philosophy, religion, are divorced from instinct at their peril. Then you get the philosophers and preachers who exhibit great powers of mind but cannot touch the heart. Sometimes the search for meaning out of experience manifests as an escape from a sultry swamp into more spacious territory! Travel is one traditional Sagittarian way of broadening one's horizons.
